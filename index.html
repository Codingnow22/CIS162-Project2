Our firm experience dates back to 1953, with Landon Surveying and Engineering, later transitioning to California Engineering Company in 1996.</p>
       <p>Our firm practice is to be an extension of your staff. Our #1 priority is to communicate,communicate, communicate. There are a lot of civil design and surveying firms whom are capable of doing your work, BUT, what sets our firm apart is our commitment to listen and communicate with our clients.</p>

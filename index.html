       <h2>We Are Infrastructure Civil Engineers and Land Surveyors</h2>
       <p>We help public agencies, special districts and private developers, plan, develop, and design infrastructure to serve a wide variety of projects. We provide land surveying and mapping services both coupled with, and independent of our civil design services. We also provide construction administration/management/inspection services helping our clients take projects from inception through completion. Our firm experience dates back to 1953, with Landon Surveying and Engineering, later transitioning to California Engineering Company in 1996.</p>
       <p>Our firm practice is to be an extension of your staff. Our #1 priority is to communicate,communicate, communicate. There are a lot of civil design and surveying firms whom are capable of doing your work, BUT, what sets our firm apart is our commitment to listen and communicate with our clients.</p>
